# Circle-Variance-Median-Filter-for-Body-Temperature
E((X-E(X))^(sqrt(2)+sqrt(-2))) so called circle variance (Meridian Filter) is used to find out stable region of the body temperature measurement process through fore head etc.
Excel files are inputs, the Python code does the calculation variations, jpeg is one of the related references.
